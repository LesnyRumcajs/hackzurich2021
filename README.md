![CI](https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs/hackzurich2021/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

## Development

### Prerequisites
Linux with Docker (or MacOS with Docker for MacOS). Should work on WSL2 without too much hassle as well. Nothing else!

### Data
Put the extracted Siemens Challenge static CSV data ([link!](http://hackzurich.siemens.cool/#/)) to directory `static_data` (too large to upload here). It should look like this:
```
‚ùØ ls static_data/
disruptions.csv  events.csv  Mapping_Events_Disruptions.csv  rssi.csv  velocities.csv
```

### Setup
You need the environmental variables below set up, e.g.
```
export INFLUX_BUCKET=hackzurich
export INFLUX_ORG=HackZurich
export INFLUX_USERNAME=admin
export INFLUX_PASSWORD=<YOURPASSWORD>
export INFLUX_ADMIN_TOKEN=<YOURTOKEN>
```

Build the traffic generator and system configuration:
```
make build
```
Bring the system up:
```
make compose_up
```
Run the traffic generator with for a short time to check if all is good:
```
make run_simulator
```

Other recipes can be found in the [Makefile](https://github.com/LesnyRumcajs/hackzurich2021/blob/main/Makefile).
